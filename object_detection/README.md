# Object detection with Tensorflow Lite on Android
This project is a static images demonstration for object detection API on Android devices.
The original project is included in the official Tensorflow repository:
>[Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).

And, how to run the model on Android devices is also described in the following page:
>[Running on mobile with TensorFlow Lite](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_on_mobile_tensorflowlite.md)
